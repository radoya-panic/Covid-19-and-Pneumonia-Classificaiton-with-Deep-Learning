# Covid-19 and Pneumonia Classificaiton with Deep Learning

## About
This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Skill Path 'Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow'. I use the python library called Keras - which allows for an interface between python and tensorflow.

The purpose of this model is to classify chest x-rarys into three categories: covid, normal, and viral pneumonia The purpose of project was to practice constructing CNNs (convolutional neural networks). The dataset is small, thereby limiting the accuracy of any deep learning model that can be applied - this is because deep learning models are for applications in which there are large datasets on which to train.

### Project goal
You are a researcher in a hospital lab and are given the task to develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. At your disposal, you have a set X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, you will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan. You hope this model can help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans and open a dialogue between your research team and the medical staff to create learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible.
